## 🧠 Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning (regression) to predict car prices. It uses a dataset containing real-world information on used cars and trains a model using **Linear Regression** to determine the estimated price based on key factors. It's an ideal project for learning regression techniques and building end-to-end ML workflows.
